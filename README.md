micro-sql
=========

A playground exploring Scala and JDBC interaction

In short
========

This is just a small library based on the code in this [article](https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SYGN/Simplifying-jdbc).
It has actually been used in production (just the SQL part) in a small web app (now offline).

Example use
===========

Look at the tests! :)

License
=======

This code is based on work of others where the license was not specified. So I release the rest of the work under the [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org)
